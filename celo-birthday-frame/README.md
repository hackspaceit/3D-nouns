**It's your birthday? Prove it and get your friends to gift you gifts!**

This project provides a simple contract and frontend for distributing USDC to people on their birthdays, serving as a straightforward example of integrating Self.
This example introduces a contract that verifies a user's passport birthday and allows them to claim USDC if their date of birth is within Â±5 days of the current date, along with a frontend that integrates this functionality.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- It is recommended to install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) before starting, which will be useful for testing the frontend locally.

### Deploying the Contract

1. Navigate to the contracts directory:

   ```bash
   cd contracts
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Build the contracts:

   ```bash
   yarn run build
   ```

4. Configure the passport environment in the `contracts/ignition/modules/SelfHappyBirthday.ts` file:
   - For real passports (production environment) i.e CELO MAINNET:
     Uncomment the line for production and comment the staging line:

     ```javascript
     const DEFAULT_IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_HUB = "0x77117D60eaB7C044e785D68edB6C7E0e134970Ea";
     ```

   - For mock passports (staging/testing environment) i.e CELO TESTNET:
     Keep the staging environment line uncommented (default):

     ```javascript
     const DEFAULT_IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_HUB = "0x3e2487a250e2A7b56c7ef5307Fb591Cc8C83623D";
     ```

5. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in the required values in the `.env` file

6. Deploy the contracts:

   ```bash
   yarn run deploy
   ```

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in the required values in the `.env` file

4. Configure the passport mode in `frontend/app/page.tsx`:
   - For real passports (production environment):
     Set `devMode` to `false` in the `selfApp` configuration:

     ```javascript
     devMode: false,
     ```

   - For mock passports (staging/testing environment):
     Set `devMode` to `true` in the `selfApp` configuration:

     ```javascript
     devMode: true,
     ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

6. Set up ngrok for local development:
   - In a new terminal, start ngrok to expose your local server:

     ```bash
     ngrok http 3000
     ```

   - Copy the generated ngrok URL (it will look like `https://xxxx-xxx-xxx-xx.ngrok-free.app`)
   - Open `frontend/app/page.tsx` and find the `endpoint` line in the `selfApp` configuration (around line 60)
   - Replace the existing URL with your ngrok URL:

     ```javascript
     endpoint: "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/verify",
     ```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

8. If in DevMode to get your mock passport read this [documentation]("https://docs.self.xyz/use-self/using-mock-passports).
